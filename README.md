This repository contains the code, scenarios, and experimentation utilities for a Master’s thesis focused on the spatiotemporal planning of aircraft within a maintenance hangar. The problem is formulated as a continuous-time MILP (with time measured in days) and is solved using Pyomo and Gurobi. The tool produces reproducible and auditable outputs, including a position-based Gantt chart, reports and KPIs, together with ex-post validation of critical constraints.
It includes the model, additional codes for generating scenarios for experimenting, batch runner of these scenarios and results runner to create graphs to understand the model performance. Additionally scenarios and the most complex case of use tested are available.
