This repository contains the code, scenarios, and experimentation utilities for a Master’s thesis focused on the spatiotemporal planning of aircraft within a maintenance hangar. The problem is formulated as a continuous-time MILP (with time measured in days) and is solved using Pyomo and Gurobi. The tool produces reproducible and auditable outputs, including a position-based Gantt chart, reports and KPIs, together with ex-post validation of critical constraints.
